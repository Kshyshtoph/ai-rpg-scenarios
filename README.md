# ai-rpg-scenarios

## 1.This purely fun project!
In this repository I make an attempt to make AI good at one specific use case - creating RPG scenarios. 

## 2. background
1) my family bought a boardgame, which turned out not to be a board game bat TTRPG. 
2) Approximatelly at the same time chatGPT lost its inital hype and became unclugged enought to begin some practice project with it

## 3. What I use
1) chatGPT npm module to templatiate my requests [chatgpt module](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api)
2) openai official image API [openai homepage](https://openai.com/)
3) vanillaJS for front end and expressjs for backend [see in npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
anything that I find apropriate for my needs will append in this list
